This project focuses on improving the detection of brain tumors by utilizing deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze MRI images. Through models like DenseNet, ResNet, and YOLO, the goal is to automate and enhance the accuracy of tumor identification, aiding radiologists in providing more precise diagnoses.
